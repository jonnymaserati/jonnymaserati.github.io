[jonnymaserati][jonnymaserati] is a Wells Engineer who from 1998 to 2019 worked around the globe on various projects with Shell. In 2019, he decided to learn how to program because he wanted to automate well trajectory planning.

When not consulting as a Wells Engineer, he's writing code. Or walking his dog. Or playing Splatoon with his girls.
