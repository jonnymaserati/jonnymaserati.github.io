This is a site dedicated to support Wells and Drilling Engineers in the digitalization transition, focusing on the application of the Python programming language to automate the boring stuff, manage, process and extract knowledge from wells/drilling data sets and create new ways of working so that we can concentrate on the fun stuff.

With detailed, worked examples that are presented under a [permissive license][apache-license-2.0] that allows you to download, copy and share the code, the intent is to accelerate the learning curve for Wells/Drilling Engineers on their quest to make it turn to the right more efficiently.
